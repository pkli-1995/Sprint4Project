# Sprint4Project
TripleTen DA Sprint 4 Project

For this project, we are given a dataframe of used vehicles. My project was to analyze the data that was given. I chose to use the make of the car and to compare it to different columns. 

For the analysis, the following graphs were made:
1. Total Amount of the Types of Car with Each Make
2. Prices Compared to the Odometer of Each Make Listed
3. Prices Compared to the Model Year of Each Make Listed
4. Total Amount of the Types of Car with Each Make

By clicking the keys on the graphs, you can easily remove or show the data allowing you to analyze between different makes or just show what one makes data was.

A checkbox was made to show what cars were listed before 2000, between 2000-2010, and after 2010.

To achieve this, I used VScode to do the intital data analysis and copied over the draft graphs to be displayed onto streamlit. I ran this through render until the link was viable. I used 3 different libraries through jupyter: streamlit, pandas, and plotly.express.

To launch the project, simply follow the link below:

For my first time, it was definitely difficult to navigate, but overall it was great experience to be able to work with this.
